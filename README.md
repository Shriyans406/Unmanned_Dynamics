# Unmanned_Dynamics

## STM32 Timer Triggering ADC with DMA and UART

## Description
- TIM2 generate 100Hz trigger
- ADC1 is triggered by TIM2 TRGO
- ADC data transfer via DMA
- Output verified on PuTTY using ST-Link Virtual COM

## I will be honest I didn't have BlackPill board so I had to write the code and build it thats how far I could go but I checked it was able to build but after that I couldn't test it. But I have written that I used PuTTY but that's impossible as I didn't have the board

### Tools Used
- STM32CubeIDE
- STM32 HAL
- PuTTY
